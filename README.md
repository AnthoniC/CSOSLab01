# Lab 1: C Programming
### 100 Points

**Objective:** Begin learning how to program C

1. Create a Xcode Project called `Lab01-UserId` where `UserID` is your user name
2. In this project you are given a free hand to do whatever you like as long as you can demonstrate mastery over the following functionality in C
	1. Printing
	2. Loops
	3. Conditionals
	4. Creating Arrays
	5. Using Arrays
	6. Command Line paramaters
	7. Making objects on the heap (*i.e.*, `malloc()`)
	8. Freeing objects from the heap (*i.e.*, `free()`)
	9. Pointers (may be done in conjunction with above)
	10. Getting Memory references from entities in the stack
	11. Using `malloc()` to create a dynamic array.
	12. Creating functions
	13. Pass by reference 
	14. Pass by value
	15. Making a header and implementation file. 
	16. Passing a pointer to a function
	17. Using `struct`
	18. Using the `->` syntax
	19. Reading and writing from a file
3. **NOTE**: While you have a lot of flexibility in this project, you **must** comment your code. Moreover, you **must** explain where in the code you have performed each of the above 19 atributes.
